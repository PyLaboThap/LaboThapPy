    Component: Pump

    Model: Based on the Thesis of RÃ©mi Dickes. Semi-empirical model.

    **Description**:
        This model is used to simulate the performances and the behavior of pumps.
        The parameters need to be calibrated with experimental data.

    **Assumption**:
        Steady-state operation.

    **Connectors**:
        su (MassConnector): Mass connector for the suction side.

        ex (MassConnector): Mass connector for the exhaust side.

        W_pp (WorkConnector): Work connector to connect to a potential motor model.

    **Parameters**:
