Pump - Similarity Law Model
================================

Model description
-----------------

The model uses the characteristic curve for one reference speed of a pump and 
uses the pump similarity laws to calculate the performance at different speeds and for other fluids.
The model description is available in the `PDF document <../../../../_static/pdf_files/PumpSimLaw.pdf>`_.
