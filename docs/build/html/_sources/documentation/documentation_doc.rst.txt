Documentation
=============

This section includes documentation about the PyLaboThap library. The documentation section is divided in three parts:

- **Connector**: This section includes the documentation of how the connector modules were implemented and how to use them.
- **Component**: This section includes the documentation of how the component modules were implemented and how to use them. It also includes all of the necessary information about each model of component. 
- **Machine**: This section includes the documentation of how the machine modules were implemented and how to use them.

The library is designed to be modular and easy to use. Object-oriented programming is used to create the classes and methods that are used to model the different components of the system
